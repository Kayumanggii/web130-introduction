  <h1>Hello! My name is CLARA</h1>
  <p>
    Seattle born, Philippine rasied (Camiguin Island to be exact). 
    Jesus lover, Whiskey drinker, Dog + Cat mama, and 2000's Hiphop and RnB kind of gal.
  </p>
    
  <p>
    I was a preschool teacher in my past life and loved everything about it.
    I had to make a decision to switch careers since teaching was unfortunately not paying my Seattle living bills. 
    I transitioned temporarily into working in the healthcare field while figuring out adulting and what sparked joy in my life.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, I decided to go back to school. I have always loved design and decided
    on pursing an Associate in Applied Science in Web Design. 
    I have been having so much fun learning throughout my classes and super excited to be done by the 
    end of Fall 2020 Quater. Woot woot!
